Michael Buriek (US): Know when it's recording.: Kevin Zhao (US): Got it.: Michael Buriek (US): Great.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's reporting.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do you see the transcript on the right?: Kevin Zhao (US): Where am I?: Kevin Zhao (US): The only person I can see it.: Michael Buriek (US): I think you may be the only person you can.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Michael Buriek (US): Transcript. Ohh.: Michael Buriek (US): Wow.: Kevin Zhao (US): No.: Kevin Zhao (US): Or what?: Michael Buriek (US): May be careful.: Kevin Zhao (US): Why did it record that as no?: Michael Buriek (US): Yes, is no.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, well, uh, that's not good.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, well, that's expected.: Michael Buriek (US): There will most likely be incorrect transcriptions, and so we'll need to parse through that, but uh, I think you're right.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Michael Buriek (US): Agenda or today are action item for today is definitely submitting our idea to the Google Oracle AI factory form.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait, OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm I'm opening a new document.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm gonna create a base template right now for meeting minutes.: Michael Buriek (US): Thank you.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): Here we got AI.: Kevin Zhao (US): We should just have a SharePoint folder.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, and then we could just share all of our documents through there.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Let's.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yazan, you wanna you wanna create one?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, what?: Michael Buriek (US): When's my due date?: Michael Buriek (US): When when do you want me to have the SharePoint folder done?: Kevin Zhao (US): I think I'm just kind of create one right now.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, then you do it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let me let me see.: Kevin Zhao (US): Should we go here?: Kevin Zhao (US): No, that's not what I asked.: Michael Buriek (US): Wait, can you share?: Michael Buriek (US): Share your screen so I can see where you're going.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I'm just I.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well, I think what you have to do is you have to create a team on Microsoft Teams.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm kind of just like figuring it out right now.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): So you go into teams and then I think you create a team.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's not let me create a team that which is kind of weird. Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Have a change.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't wanna.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, let me see if I can create.: Kevin Zhao (US): Don't.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): Think I have.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't think I have permissions.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I don't think we can.: Kevin Zhao (US): The only the the only other option would be we use Google Drive.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do that.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's just have a Google Drive.: Kevin Zhao (US): Should I hate?: Kevin Zhao (US): And that should be, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, we can obviously we can transfer it to a SharePoint site if we are able to create it later so.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's not.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's not a big deal.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's let's do let's do Google.: Kevin Zhao (US): Alright, so I'm gonna go into Google right now and it's only and just do it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Gmail.: Kevin Zhao (US): Actually, what's going on this?: Kevin Zhao (US): See.: Kevin Zhao (US): Drive.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, I'm going to do.: Kevin Zhao (US): New just you, it's two folder.: Kevin Zhao (US): Orange.: Michael Buriek (US): When you share it with me, I'm gonna drop in the Jupiter notebook and the diagram dot IO flow chart.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'll try to do new folder.: Kevin Zhao (US): Others.: Kevin Zhao (US): AI projects.: Kevin Zhao (US): Alright.: Michael Buriek (US): Very nice.: Michael Buriek (US): Very nice.: Michael Buriek (US): E it's.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): I, by the way, I spoke with Dave before this call and let him know that I may be recording some meetings and stuff like that and producing meeting minutes for it internally just to feed this AI model.: Kevin Zhao (US): And he's on board with it like he's cool with that so.: Michael Buriek (US): You know it's that's awesome.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh-huh.: Michael Buriek (US): I actually today I had a meeting with Vijay and I E He asked me to show him what I've been working on.: Michael Buriek (US): Cause I'm not staffed right now and he was super stoked.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, he likes it.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, he was very excited.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's crazy.: Michael Buriek (US): He was very interested in it and he said it's a great use case.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right, dude.: Kevin Zhao (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): So, faith on how Kevin's fates on hall.: Kevin Zhao (US): We we gotta send it that idea ASAP because I'm scared.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ohh actually I'm not even scared.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't know how many people are thinking about that as like an idea, but just to be safe because I don't want us to, like, go this deep in all this work and then all of a sudden it's like, ohh somebody else already came up with an idea.: Kevin Zhao (US): So you can't, you know, like that would really suck.: Kevin Zhao (US): I would cry.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I agree.: Kevin Zhao (US): I cry.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm great I got your Google Drive invitation.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let me an audio.: Michael Buriek (US): Go ahead and open this also.: Michael Buriek (US): By rename it, you wouldn't mind, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't care.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, do it.: Michael Buriek (US): That's all right.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Michael Buriek (US): Priority my drive.: Michael Buriek (US): Shared with me.: Kevin Zhao (US): Alright, Michael Buriek, bible.buriek@poc.com right here.: Kevin Zhao (US): Emails just first last name with the dot.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): My goal dot buriek.: Michael Buriek (US): At pwc.com.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, uh, #2 got it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Got it.: Michael Buriek (US): A I just dropped those two into it.: Michael Buriek (US): It's good rename.: Kevin Zhao (US): Idea title.: Kevin Zhao (US): Meeting minute model, meaning minutes model.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Idea description.: Kevin Zhao (US): Practices.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Space.: Kevin Zhao (US): On raw transcription file. Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Meeting minutes.: Kevin Zhao (US): Excuse me.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, I named it PW C underscore Gen AI underscore projects.: Michael Buriek (US): And then I created a meeting minutes folder within it and I dropped in the Jupyter notebook and the flow chart.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, you know what I was thinking, Kevin?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): If we wanted to bring on one more person, the only reason I was thinking that might be useful is if we find someone who's super good at deck Prep who can pee.: Michael Buriek (US): WCF I all of our content so we don't have to, umm.: Michael Buriek (US): Focus.: Michael Buriek (US): I guess our time on.: Kevin Zhao (US): Presentation.: Michael Buriek (US): On presentation.: Kevin Zhao (US): Dude, don't worry about.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'll do that.: Michael Buriek (US): You want to do that?: Kevin Zhao (US): I can do that.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's not bro.: Kevin Zhao (US): No one better at deck prep than me.: Kevin Zhao (US): I haven't freaking good at that like she.: Michael Buriek (US): Ooh, I like that.: Michael Buriek (US): I like that.: Michael Buriek (US): The the trans.: Kevin Zhao (US): But I'm not gonna lie.: Kevin Zhao (US): I I have made some really good looking decks, so yeah, you need to worry about it.: Kevin Zhao (US): I got that artwork down.: Michael Buriek (US): That's good.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, let me see this meeting minutes model.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, wait, Kevin.: Michael Buriek (US): Can I?: Michael Buriek (US): Can I let me let me send you.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do I just copy page?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): 'cause you.: Michael Buriek (US): Let me send you the the Jupiter notebook project description that I already made.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, you already have it.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I just want to take that.: Michael Buriek (US): And it's super clean, OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I read it when you shared it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let me wait.: Kevin Zhao (US): Did you drop the?: Michael Buriek (US): Control C let me send it to you in the chat.: Kevin Zhao (US): It was just it downloads.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, you you have to open it in VS code and I don't think you have a Jupyter notebook, so I just sent it to you.: Kevin Zhao (US): I've no pad.: Michael Buriek (US): I just sent it in the chat.: Michael Buriek (US): So let me know when you get it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I got it.: Michael Buriek (US): Very nice.: Kevin Zhao (US): The project aims to develop an advanced generative AI application design and transform raw, meaning transatlantic.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, just going to do this.: Michael Buriek (US): Are we able to attach?: Michael Buriek (US): In files.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I just start character.: Kevin Zhao (US): You look at that.: Michael Buriek (US): Are we able to attach files to this submission?: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): We haven't gotten down to that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I don't think so.: Kevin Zhao (US): Function or sector.: Kevin Zhao (US): Your idea applies to dude.: Kevin Zhao (US): What affect every?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): He obviously won.: Michael Buriek (US): PwC wide firm wide firm wide, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): From like like that from what?: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see here capability type, this is summarization.: Kevin Zhao (US): Summarize, but also, you know, like I I think summarization but also I think it's augmentation because we're.: Kevin Zhao (US): That nuclear.: Michael Buriek (US): So its creation it is summarization and creation.: Michael Buriek (US): UM, it's not deep retrieval.: Kevin Zhao (US): Expanding brings us and contents such as autocomplete or synthetic data creation, and she.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Definitely summarization.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well, I mean, I think we can only choose one anyways.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, well, here's a question I have.: Michael Buriek (US): The email was sent out by.: Michael Buriek (US): If I look at AI factory com no, no.: Kevin Zhao (US): Who actually honestly create?: Michael Buriek (US): Blackman.: Michael Buriek (US): I wonder if if we wanted to kind of highlight or flash what it is that we've created, I wonder if we can also email it saying that the form didn't allow us to.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I think I'm going to do that.: Michael Buriek (US): Do do we want to do that too?: Kevin Zhao (US): Where?: Kevin Zhao (US): What the to add an attachment you mean?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Sure.: Michael Buriek (US): And I don't like how you.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, you have to reach out to Noah Blackman and C Hakeem Rabiu and Jerry my Macario.: Michael Buriek (US): Very nice.: Kevin Zhao (US): The project needs to develop an advanced generative AI application design and transform RAW meeting transcripts and concise, well formatted executive summaries.: Kevin Zhao (US): You realizing natural language processing techniques that application will extract key points, decisions and action items with high precision.: Kevin Zhao (US): The system will ensure that the resulting meeting minutes is capitalized.: Kevin Zhao (US): The essence of the discussions, tailored to organizational standards for official record keeping, emphasizing user friendliness.: Kevin Zhao (US): The interface will facilitate seamless integration into existing meeting and documentation workflows.: Kevin Zhao (US): This initiative stands to significantly enhanced productivity by automating the particular task of meeting minutes preparation, thereby allowing Gmail and stuff.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the thing.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Some questions I don't meticulous the right word for this.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's say like the.: Michael Buriek (US): Kevin, Kevin, I think I think I am gonna try to set up a meeting with Noah Blackman and just let him know, like, hey, what we've done and whether or not we can cause.: Michael Buriek (US): I wanna be a part of build.: Michael Buriek (US): Well I am building.: Michael Buriek (US): I wanna build it so I don't just want to submit the idea.: Kevin Zhao (US): No, I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm cool with that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, that's.: Kevin Zhao (US): I mean they you think they're gonna build it?: Kevin Zhao (US): No, we wait.: Kevin Zhao (US): No one tell.: Michael Buriek (US): There's just an idea right now.: Michael Buriek (US): They're just gonna let us know if the idea is good and they're gonna win.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): How important is this description?: Kevin Zhao (US): Actually, that's fine.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't think I. OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do you wanna get?: Kevin Zhao (US): Feel free to email them with attachments of what we already have.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I can even put in additional comments.: Kevin Zhao (US): Michael will email.: Kevin Zhao (US): Noah black men and team.: Michael Buriek (US): Let me let me drop that right now.: Michael Buriek (US): Let me do that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well, email with attachments of current POC.: Michael Buriek (US): So new email and I'm going to put in.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see, it's going to be Noah Blackman.: Michael Buriek (US): And it, Kim ribu.: Kevin Zhao (US): Team has already begun building out POC Michael.: Michael Buriek (US): And it's going to be the.: Kevin Zhao (US): Michael, you know, blocking team.: Michael Buriek (US): Unwind AI. Uh.: Michael Buriek (US): It's going to be the Oracle AI factory, and it's gonna be.: Michael Buriek (US): Meeting minutes.: Kevin Zhao (US): What?: Kevin Zhao (US): What exactly are the attachments?: Kevin Zhao (US): Is the Jupiter notebook.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I'm just gonna attach that.: Kevin Zhao (US): With Jupiter notebook and paining, uh, current model current model.: Kevin Zhao (US): That that makes sense.: Kevin Zhao (US): Attaining.: Kevin Zhao (US): Both for current uh.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Tango must say.: Kevin Zhao (US): There.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, sure. See.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm conference is being built.: Kevin Zhao (US): As OK, let's see brief description of the demo OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Showcase.: Kevin Zhao (US): The consumption of a transcription transcription file.: Kevin Zhao (US): And.: Kevin Zhao (US): You I.: Kevin Zhao (US): And demonstrate.: Kevin Zhao (US): In the demo, we will showcase the consumption of the transcription file and the UI and demonstrate how.: Kevin Zhao (US): API.: Kevin Zhao (US): Realizes.: Kevin Zhao (US): There's.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh open AI framework to process and uh produced.: Kevin Zhao (US): Meeting minutes.: Kevin Zhao (US): Have what?: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, I mean, that's similar meeting minutes.: Kevin Zhao (US): It is.: Kevin Zhao (US): Get that's.: Kevin Zhao (US): And yeah, personalize getting out.: Kevin Zhao (US): And.: Kevin Zhao (US): Scared.: Michael Buriek (US): Who did you just send me a teams message?: Kevin Zhao (US): So.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, this makes sense.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, let me go ahead and take a look.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I it's brief description I'm not writing.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm just one sense in the demo we will showcase the consumption of a transcription file in the UI and demonstrate how the API utilizer the Open AI framework to process and produce meeting minutes and emails containing action items catered to recipient.: Michael Buriek (US): I think that's good.: Michael Buriek (US): I think honestly US, umm, showcasing it on a meeting with them would be great.: Michael Buriek (US): So I can see.: Michael Buriek (US): See you Kevin's out.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): And so this is what I've written thus far.: Michael Buriek (US): I know it and her.: Kevin Zhao (US): I think.: Michael Buriek (US): Kim, my teammate Kevin Zhao, and I just submitted our idea for the Oracle AI factory competition via the Google form.: Kevin Zhao (US): Single.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm attaching the Jupiter notebook of the project that I've begun building and a flow chart showing the use case.: Michael Buriek (US): The project.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And any additional, any additional comments, I I put a team has already begun building out proof of concept.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Michael will email no Blackman and team with Jupiter notebook, where current POC is being built.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Good personal comment.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, I I gotta submit.: Kevin Zhao (US): Alright, read this one more time.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let me know what you think.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't want this to sound tacky.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, it's not in the UI.: Michael Buriek (US): It would be in the demo we will showcase the consumption of a transcription file.: Michael Buriek (US): By.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, by the model.: Michael Buriek (US): And demonstrate how the API how and demonstrate.: Michael Buriek (US): No, I don't like that.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Michael Buriek (US): In the demo, we will showcase.: Michael Buriek (US): The.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see the transformation of a transcription file.: Michael Buriek (US): Of a meeting transcription file I would start that.: Michael Buriek (US): So in the demo we will showcase the transformation of a meeting transcription file.: Michael Buriek (US): Into.: Michael Buriek (US): An open AI.: Michael Buriek (US): API accepted.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right.: Michael Buriek (US): API accepted format.: Michael Buriek (US): And.: Michael Buriek (US): The.: Michael Buriek (US): Microsoft Graph API.: Kevin Zhao (US): Draft API.: Michael Buriek (US): A graph like a mask graph.: Michael Buriek (US): Integration.: Michael Buriek (US): To.: Michael Buriek (US): See send open AI response.: Kevin Zhao (US): Send and open AI response.: Michael Buriek (US): Send the open a, say, send the meeting minutes, open AI response.: Michael Buriek (US): To meeting attendees.: Michael Buriek (US): There.: Kevin Zhao (US): And the demo we will showcase the transformation of a meeting transcription file into an 8 open AI API acceptor format and and that's graph API integration to send.: Kevin Zhao (US): The meeting minutes open AI response to meeting attendees.: Kevin Zhao (US): And then open AI API acceptor format and Ms Graph API integration.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't even know what this is.: Kevin Zhao (US): But what?: Kevin Zhao (US): What does Emma's graph API integration?: Kevin Zhao (US): What?: Kevin Zhao (US): What's what?: Kevin Zhao (US): What does Ms graph?: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, there are two there are two API open AI and Ms graph.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, got it.: Michael Buriek (US): Microsoft Graph Microsoft Graph is the API that Microsoft 365 uses to connect to.: Michael Buriek (US): It's a rest API that connects to every Microsoft Project, product, Excel, word, teams, Outlook, SharePoint.: Michael Buriek (US): It allows you to access data and submit data, so it's the API that allows us to connect to the Microsoft suite and connect to each attendee of the meeting.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ohh.: Michael Buriek (US): So we'll be using it to extract the meeting transcript directly as well as to send out an email.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, an automated email to them.: Kevin Zhao (US): Customization I'm working.: Michael Buriek (US): So it's a really important API in this whole process.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, well, so is it more of like a, I don't know if I would say transformation well transformation and transcription file.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, this is this is the.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, so I I I get I get transformation into accepted format but then transformation into your Ms Graph API in a permission.: Michael Buriek (US): The whole flow is this.: Michael Buriek (US): In the demo, we will showcase Umm, an application that utilize.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do this.: Michael Buriek (US): Can you rewrite this, Kevin?: Michael Buriek (US): I'll just.: Michael Buriek (US): I'll just give you the whole process flow verbally.: Kevin Zhao (US): I have.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait, let me see if I can pull up.: Michael Buriek (US): So in the go, after a showcase cause.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yes.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, there's what we're doing.: Michael Buriek (US): So in the demo.: Michael Buriek (US): We will showcase a Microsoft application.: Michael Buriek (US): No it an application because it integrates both.: Michael Buriek (US): So an application.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, this makes more sense.: Michael Buriek (US): That.: Kevin Zhao (US): I think we need to make it like layman terms.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, that.: Michael Buriek (US): That utilizes.: Michael Buriek (US): The Microsoft Graph API.: Michael Buriek (US): To connect, wait.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I can't open, OK that.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, to connect to teams.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Michael Buriek (US): And will extract or and we'll make a call for. That's.: Michael Buriek (US): That's the true technical way and will make we'll.: Kevin Zhao (US): All.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see how it is that utilizes the Microsoft Graph API to.: Kevin Zhao (US): Back to teams.: Michael Buriek (US): Make an API call.: Michael Buriek (US): E to connect to teams, wait to.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I went to connect to teams can to connect to teams.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, to make it all right, let's to connect to teams for a meeting transcript.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, just keep it like high level for now and we could.: Michael Buriek (US): For a meeting transcript, this meeting transcript.: Michael Buriek (US): Will be.: Kevin Zhao (US): Bad.: Michael Buriek (US): Transformed.: Michael Buriek (US): Into a format.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's forms into an open and the OK and you format.: Michael Buriek (US): A format that the open AI API.: Kevin Zhao (US): You know by the open AI.: Michael Buriek (US): Are APIs.: Michael Buriek (US): And return.: Michael Buriek (US): A summarized.: Michael Buriek (US): Meeting minutes document.: Michael Buriek (US): Formatted to show.: Michael Buriek (US): So.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Ah, he items, action items.: Michael Buriek (US): Attendees on.: Kevin Zhao (US): Actually, I was a decisions where let's just say uh key points.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah, actually, I like that he items.: Michael Buriek (US): Action items.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm just this is the this is, this is what you had in the.: Kevin Zhao (US): In the summary key points, decisions, action items, I mean we could probably we probably include attendees or like header header cause you'll have attendees date.: Kevin Zhao (US): You know all that stuff, right?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Show header key points, decisions and action items.: Kevin Zhao (US): You know I don't do parking lot.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's fine.: Kevin Zhao (US): Better sales viewpoints decision.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And the devil?: Kevin Zhao (US): We will showcase an application that you utilize the Ms Graph API to connect to teams for meeting transcripts.: Kevin Zhao (US): This meeting transcript will be will then be transformed into a format that can be consumed by the open AI API and return.: Kevin Zhao (US): And summarized meeting minutes document formatted to show a header key points as an action item.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, I'm gonna say this transformed.: Kevin Zhao (US): Will that be transformed and can I just say fed into the open AI API to return?: Kevin Zhao (US): With.: Kevin Zhao (US): Organized and raised.: Kevin Zhao (US): Eating less talking.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I was by Heather.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's well, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Say something I say to return a meeting minutes.: Kevin Zhao (US): Document that organized by header key points decision that I could have.: Kevin Zhao (US): Project Answer the other answer sure.: Kevin Zhao (US): I've got a meeting minutes here.: Kevin Zhao (US): You realize a natural language processing techniques that location will extract that our details keep forcing.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep, like that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, we can't take it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Set.: Kevin Zhao (US): Character details key points to such that action item system.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, orange hair.: Kevin Zhao (US): Nice.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm sure my sister, my sister will ensure that the results are meeting event.: Kevin Zhao (US): The system.: Kevin Zhao (US): Sure, there was nothing as the caps like yes that's that's discussions chillier to organizational Spanish or visual record keeping.: Kevin Zhao (US): Fantasizing user family knows there are those officewala taste.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I should understand soon.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't think it's running this task.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): O.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's right.: Kevin Zhao (US): What, Michael?: Kevin Zhao (US): Ah, you see what I highlighted right here.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do you wanna keep this or I?: Kevin Zhao (US): I think we need it.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): We need to like either tweak this, get rid of it, or yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): No, no, that's all good.: Michael Buriek (US): The project aims to develop an advanced Gen AI.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm talking what?: Michael Buriek (US): I know, I know.: Michael Buriek (US): I just.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm highlight, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm just reading through it design to transform wrong meeting the concise well form any utilizing natural language processing techniques to application will extract header details, key points, decisions and action items.: Michael Buriek (US): The system will ensure that the resulting meeting minutes encapsulates the essence of the discussions.: Michael Buriek (US): Now the the meeting minutes summarizes the discussion.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I like that more and capture the essences and little some.: Michael Buriek (US): Summarizes the the discussion.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Some summarize that the resulting neediness summarized the discussions test.: Kevin Zhao (US): This is tailored to organizational stands for official record keeping.: Kevin Zhao (US): Are you or are we saying?: Michael Buriek (US): Summarizes summarizes the discussion.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like like 4 formatted with proper formats.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ken says nothing about it.: Michael Buriek (US): And produces.: Michael Buriek (US): No, you know that that wait that the resulting no.: Michael Buriek (US): The system will ensure.: Michael Buriek (US): No, no, no, that's wrong.: Michael Buriek (US): The application will produce.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well, so, but then.: Michael Buriek (US): You're right, you're right. OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): But then we kind of repeat were saying up here application designed to transform raw meat into, I think we did for mood this sentence.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, emphasizing user friendliness.: Kevin Zhao (US): The interface will facilitate seamless integration and existing meeting and documentation workflows.: Kevin Zhao (US): I I mean I think that's kind of like complied.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't think we need a state that.: Kevin Zhao (US): What do you like?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I think that's good.: Kevin Zhao (US): But you want.: Kevin Zhao (US): You wanna remove it or because I'm thinking we just removed that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Keep it nice and short.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, let's remove it.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's keep it short.: Kevin Zhao (US): And then that way we have the description of the idea.: Kevin Zhao (US): Umm, the method of how to create it and then the impact it has?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): What are the three sentences right project aims to develop and advance to generative AI application besides transform, robbing and transfer to concisely before.: Kevin Zhao (US): I mean, that's utilizing natural language processing techniques.: Kevin Zhao (US): Traditional thought.: Kevin Zhao (US): You had her details queue points to sit in that action item.: Kevin Zhao (US): This initiative stands to significantly enhanced productivity by automating the extraneous task meaning minutes preparation, thereby allowing team members to focus on more strategic activities.: Kevin Zhao (US): We don't talk anything about like sending the email.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I'm talking about like, do we do we wanna mention that at all or should we just not talk about that?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I mean, I'm emailing them with the flow chart too, so I think that will be OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, I'm cool with that.: Michael Buriek (US): Submit. Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Can I share my screen real quick?: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm gonna submit what we call so the next save my response good.: Michael Buriek (US): Let me share my screen really quick and I'm just gonna send this email out.: Michael Buriek (US): Just wanted to flash it to you.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I, Noah, and Hakeem, my teammate, Kevin's out and I just submitted our idea.: Michael Buriek (US): I don't needs out my teammate Kevin and I just submitted our idea for the Oracle AI factory competition.: Michael Buriek (US): We were hoping to discuss our project idea in more detail with you because we would like to take the project to completion as we have already started.: Michael Buriek (US): Attached is the start of the G tighter notebook and a process flowed.: Michael Buriek (US): Applications use case.: Michael Buriek (US): Please let us know if we can schedule a short teams meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): To understand the competitions requirements.: Michael Buriek (US): And how we can stay involved with the idea to completion best Michael Beard.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Kevin Zhao (US): Sure, project you have more detail to because we would like to take the project to completion as we have already started.: Kevin Zhao (US): Tasha start the Jupiter.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ohh my God, I spelled Jupiter wrong.: Michael Buriek (US): That's OK.: Michael Buriek (US): It's like they'll understand.: Michael Buriek (US): Also, they probably don't even.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, Hakeem might.: Michael Buriek (US): Hakeem seems like he knows what the Jupiter notebook is for Python, but.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right, 'cause.: Kevin Zhao (US): He's got an Indian name.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Kevin Zhao (US): Oh, you know.: Michael Buriek (US): No, I just looked them up.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ohh OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Cheese.: Kevin Zhao (US): Bro, this transcript that we're recording is going to be so wack.: Michael Buriek (US): Hey this is important because I'm sure that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Are you are you reading this?: Kevin Zhao (US): I said Ohh OK, you said cheese dude.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): That's that's an important thing to consider because I'm positive that uh at most likely will transcribe text incorrectly, so we'll need to to engineer our prompt to prepare for.: Kevin Zhao (US): Those errors.: Michael Buriek (US): Maybe yeah, for potential errors in the text and we can also work on how we transform our information too.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I mean, I don't think, I don't think the final output is really gonna say cheese like that.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's gonna get omitted.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, that'll be omitted for sure.: Michael Buriek (US): Kevin Zahn has a deliverable to produce Brie cheese by November the 20th, so is this OK, Kevin?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I said that.: Kevin Zhao (US): I like it.: Kevin Zhao (US): You have the attachments.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's good.: Kevin Zhao (US): You have CC.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's good, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, I sent.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, we need a we.: Kevin Zhao (US): So we kind of just jumped the gun and didn't really.: Kevin Zhao (US): We never really primed this discussion with an agenda or anything.: Michael Buriek (US): No, we didn't.: Michael Buriek (US): And that's something that I think is good that we recognized because maybe next meeting before we hop on teams and we transcribe it, one of us can be the facilitator, right and take that role like pretty seriously.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I'll do that.: Michael Buriek (US): And then ensure that throughout the discussion they kind of head it and then also make assignments for tasks while we're communicating.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): On the project so we can do a little prep before the meeting just to create a really good transcript and then see how it works.: Michael Buriek (US): The reality is, though, most meetings will probably go like this, they'll probably have people discussing things on nonchalantly, just casually.: Michael Buriek (US): And so we need to make sure that our prompt template is engineered really well to prepare for that.: Michael Buriek (US): Hey, you're gonna you're gonna see a meeting transcript.: Michael Buriek (US): Most likely you'll see conversations or side conversations that have nothing to do with the objective of the meeting, which is to cover the key action items.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, please do your best to ignore the these conversations and focus on anything pertaining to the actual project et cetera, et cetera.: Michael Buriek (US): So we can work that into the the prompt template and that's something that honestly I wanted to talk to you more about maybe in our next meeting like these two templates because that's something you can totally you can do.: Kevin Zhao (US): Hmm.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah. I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm on board with that.: Michael Buriek (US): So perfect.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm actually I just create another doc in our drive and I'm gonna create a meeting minute template right now.: Kevin Zhao (US): The prop template.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm gonna have to do some refreshing on prompts because I'm not fully.: Michael Buriek (US): Ohh no.: Kevin Zhao (US): Comfortable with exactly how to create a couple of that.: Kevin Zhao (US): You know, I'm saying.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I can.: Michael Buriek (US): I I can do a walk through.: Michael Buriek (US): Basically, Kevin, no.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see, I'm sharing my screen already.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the template I used, so let me pull up the Jupiter notebook and.: Kevin Zhao (US): So there's different sections to this.: Michael Buriek (US): Here it is.: Kevin Zhao (US): We have obviously Heather.: Kevin Zhao (US): Had her.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Or already already transformed this, so I'll send it to you, Kevin. I will.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait, wait.: Michael Buriek (US): I mean, I E.: Kevin Zhao (US): I have that I have that I have it, I have it.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): You have the notebook, but it's it's not formatted really nicely.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): The solution is the solution is what we want it to look like, but the prompt that I'm passing into it here I transformed it so it's on one line which is easier to read, but I'll just go ahead and send you right now to your work email.: Michael Buriek (US): The actual one that I was using, so let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): See prompt template.: Michael Buriek (US): Input output.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): I guess we we we didn't include agenda, but I mean.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, we don't.: Kevin Zhao (US): We don't need agenda.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's fine.: Kevin Zhao (US): Had her key points action items decisions, so all we had.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's not going to do.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's.: Kevin Zhao (US): There's a bad.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, what the?: Michael Buriek (US): OK, perfect.: Michael Buriek (US): That did a bum bum.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the format that I want you to use the send it to you.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's the only that but.: Michael Buriek (US): So is a good format. Umm.: Michael Buriek (US): Booth.: Michael Buriek (US): Given.: Michael Buriek (US): And justice, remove all the stars and, UM, you'll you get the general idea of what I'm sending you.: Kevin Zhao (US): I did.: Kevin Zhao (US): I want charge.: Michael Buriek (US): Meeting minutes. Send.: Michael Buriek (US): Alright, just sent you an email.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, The thing is, the model won't be able to read that formatting that you're doing, Kevin.: Michael Buriek (US): So it has to be just straight text and you'll see.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, check your email.: Michael Buriek (US): I just sent you a meeting minutes, example and inside of it you'll see that there it's separated by square brackets and it shows basically where you should insert information and that is also part of the prompt because those are directions that we wanna include in this agenda.: Michael Buriek (US): So I'll let me know when you when you get it, cause it's important to follow a similar format.: Kevin Zhao (US): This is for the prompt though, right?: Michael Buriek (US): Yep, no, it's for the meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): It's for the the meeting minutes.: Michael Buriek (US): Are you writing this for our meeting right now?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): This is we want it.: Michael Buriek (US): We wanna use the same format that we're gonna feed into the model, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): See.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah. So.: Michael Buriek (US): So I'm sending what you got is how we need a structure.: Michael Buriek (US): The meeting minutes, like pull, pull, share your screen share screen and pull it up and I'll explain it to you.: Kevin Zhao (US): All wrong thing.: Michael Buriek (US): Because because the model we won't be able to there it is great.: Michael Buriek (US): So go ahead and you can copy that.: Michael Buriek (US): Put that in here.: Kevin Zhao (US): So you're saying that we need?: Michael Buriek (US): That's what I'm saying.: Kevin Zhao (US): There.: Michael Buriek (US): If you paste it, I'll save it.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm saying to paste it and then I'll tell you exactly.: Kevin Zhao (US): So this.: Michael Buriek (US): Can't see it yet for some reason.: Michael Buriek (US): Ah, there it is.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, so why does my mouse not work?: Michael Buriek (US): Alright, super move this basically what I'm passing is I'm gonna have this line before this that says this.: Michael Buriek (US): It's gonna say hi, Chad.: Michael Buriek (US): TBD.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): You are a meeting minutes.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the prompt is the context we're we're giving it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Here is the format I want you to use.: Michael Buriek (US): We need a right here like Please ensure that the meeting transcript has whatever people talking randomly don't include that.: Michael Buriek (US): So there's a lot there that we need to include, but that's the idea so.: Kevin Zhao (US): Format for the output.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the format for the output, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So we're saying, hey, we want you to generate something using this output and then we can remove this and have the date, the time of the meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): That's what I'm saying.: Kevin Zhao (US): But then we want but, but then eventually we will have to transform this output into a cleaner looking format, right like this is.: Kevin Zhao (US): This is the NLRB.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, this is the rough drop.: Michael Buriek (US): This is what I use.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, that's what I'm trying to communicate is this is what I made.: Michael Buriek (US): This is bad.: Michael Buriek (US): It's very simple.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So we do have a job.: Michael Buriek (US): It was just to do a proof of concept, but this square bracket format that you're seeing your insert agenda item number one title is also instructions.: Michael Buriek (US): These are instructions that I'm also giving to the model to insert material here, right?: Michael Buriek (US): And it's doing that.: Michael Buriek (US): So right here insert date.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the format we need to use.: Michael Buriek (US): Summarize the discussion and decisions made for this agenda item in bullet format.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So this is it, right?: Michael Buriek (US): Like all of this are instructions, it's so this not only acts as a general structure of the document, this also acts as.: Michael Buriek (US): UM, yes.: Michael Buriek (US): Wait, no, no, you're not.: Kevin Zhao (US): This this is the main content where like the it's just gonna spit out the content that we want and then we'll use some other tool to extract this and then put it in the format that we want it to be in in like right.: Michael Buriek (US): You're still not understanding Kevin.: Michael Buriek (US): How do I?: Michael Buriek (US): Or how do I describe this?: Michael Buriek (US): Well, you'd have to understand the code here.: Michael Buriek (US): Me.: Michael Buriek (US): I can pull it up though.: Michael Buriek (US): Should she pulled this code?: Michael Buriek (US): And this way I can teach you.: Michael Buriek (US): All right.: Michael Buriek (US): OI, just pasted in the code.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): There are three things that we're giving it.: Michael Buriek (US): This first one is what I want you to worry about.: Michael Buriek (US): The highlighted part role is the role and we're saying the role is the system.: Michael Buriek (US): So we're trying to give context to the prompt content is what we're giving it.: Michael Buriek (US): This is what I wrote.: Michael Buriek (US): You're a meeting minute generator that takes in text and uses the following format.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's what you're time, Chachi.: Kevin Zhao (US): Be too.: Michael Buriek (US): Is what I told Chad Dimity and I said this is the format O.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): These insert lines are important because not only do they act as the structure of the document, but they're also informing the model of where to insert information and what information to insert, which is why we wanna follow this format.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So this line right here.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, it's something that we need to beef up and make very concise and clean.: Michael Buriek (US): This is called prompt engineering, so this is the prompt engineering part.: Michael Buriek (US): The way that we communicate this line of hey, you are this and this is what I want you to do.: Michael Buriek (US): Will guide the model into how it produces what it does.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is extremely important that we get this right and we test multiple versions.: Kevin Zhao (US): It it's the what do you?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): What are you?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): What are you telling Chad? GBT.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's gonna do for you.: Kevin Zhao (US): That sounds very.: Michael Buriek (US): Here, here.: Michael Buriek (US): This is important because this is just the meeting that we want to have and then this is where the structure is.: Michael Buriek (US): Anything that doesn't have an insert means it's not U for subjectivity.: Michael Buriek (US): For the model to determine, but it's what we actually want as structure to the document, so we want this as structure.: Michael Buriek (US): We want meeting information as structure.: Michael Buriek (US): We want date as structure but we want this to be dynamically.: Michael Buriek (US): Changed according to the meeting transcription used, right?: Michael Buriek (US): We want time to be there every time, but insert time is the dynamic piece of this document.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Michael Buriek (US): And this needs to be formatted so there are no like loose spaces around like like that.: Michael Buriek (US): Does that make sense?: Michael Buriek (US): So, like down here, here's a way that we can make this better.: Michael Buriek (US): Here we want to insert an agenda item.: Michael Buriek (US): We don't know what the agenda is because they're gonna talk about it.: Michael Buriek (US): So the facilitator is gonna say, hey, guys, today's agenda.: Kevin Zhao (US): Set it up, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): We're gonna start with this right there, Chad GBT will read that text and understand to place the first agenda item into this.: Kevin Zhao (US): What if they don't even say that, though?: Kevin Zhao (US): Is the thing right?: Michael Buriek (US): If they don't say that, it'll do its best, and that's what we need to test.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So we need to test meetings that aren't very structured, but The thing is, I think facilitators who would like to have meeting minutes produce.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): This is part of prompting, so if they understand first that their meeting will be transcribed and that this meeting minutes will be generated, then they can be informed to maybe come into the meeting with a little more structure so that this type of document can be created.: Michael Buriek (US): And that's something that we can test out is we can test out, hey, a super unstructured meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): How does it do?: Kevin Zhao (US): Right.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like different different scenarios.: Michael Buriek (US): In a super structured meeting where we come in prepared to communicate these things clearly, right?: Michael Buriek (US): So then in this section this is also area that we want the model to insert.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's it.: Michael Buriek (US): So summarize the discussion and decisions made for this agenda item in bullet format so.: Kevin Zhao (US): Highly that.: Kevin Zhao (US): So that's another you're saying.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): So no, no.: Kevin Zhao (US): You're saying that, well, actually you so that highlight a portion of the top that that is the prompt itself or is this all being fed into?: Michael Buriek (US): So this this is context, this is called context and all this is doing is.: Kevin Zhao (US): Here's the formula I want you to use this so this entire section yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): This is brimming the model to understand its role in this specific use case, cause right now this model understands the entire English language and just has an ability to produce text.: Kevin Zhao (US): So.: Michael Buriek (US): It doesn't know the context, so we can say you are a meeting summarizer.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): You're doing this and this and this right?: Michael Buriek (US): Does that?: Michael Buriek (US): Is that enough information?: Kevin Zhao (US): No, I know.: Kevin Zhao (US): I I know that so.: Michael Buriek (US): Dynamic.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I guess right here everything in the bracket though is like essentially what we're telling.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, it's dynamic.: Kevin Zhao (US): We're telling like we're telling chat, GPT, or whoever the AI is to asset.: Kevin Zhao (US): These are like the instructions, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): And then the date, the whatever all this other stuff.: Michael Buriek (US): Yes, is the structure exactly so.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's that's structure that's like the skeleton, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): But you wanna put meat on the bones?: Michael Buriek (US): So exactly the skeleton is here.: Kevin Zhao (US): Is is the bracket?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, you want the meat here and this?: Kevin Zhao (US): Is what you're saying.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): No, these are the bones and this is the meat.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah, yes.: Michael Buriek (US): So yeah, this is the framework and this is what we're dropping on it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So that's why the framework Kevin is what you were trying to create up here.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): I just.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, let's do key points.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): We can't use this format though, but like you could switch this up, you could say instead of meeting agenda you could say key points and you could say insert key point number one title and then you could say summarize the discussion and decisions made for this agenda item, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, like that insert, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): That's something you can change so you can change that and and then you can say like hey, here are the action items for key point or you could say this you could say insert.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do this.: Michael Buriek (US): Action items for.: Kevin Zhao (US): Is so fluid though, like like there's no like, I feel like like this right here is like, I'm like talking to a human.: Michael Buriek (US): I know key point #1 uh in book poet format or whatever.: Michael Buriek (US): Whatever, right, so you understand how to build this out?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): I I got it, I got it.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, perfect.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well so so.: Michael Buriek (US): Ah, sorry, I just kind of threw it at you.: Michael Buriek (US): I was just like do this but I didn't.: Michael Buriek (US): I didn't realize that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, it's no, it's cool.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And this is pretty straightforward that I just needed some clarification.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So that that would be prompting the prompting template.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): But what about the other part?: Michael Buriek (US): So yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, let me explain this.: Kevin Zhao (US): I mean, you said you want meeting minutes template.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm the the problem is I only attached one uh so my file on my computer has a lot more information and so I'll send it to you.: Michael Buriek (US): I'll give you a tiny, quick lesson of everything that's we're building.: Michael Buriek (US): Is that alright?: Kevin Zhao (US): Right now. Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I'm.: Michael Buriek (US): Do we have time for that or OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Perfect.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm done with all my wait.: Kevin Zhao (US): Actually give me one second.: Kevin Zhao (US): I was like miss it, but I E.: Michael Buriek (US): So let me compose this Kevin Dahl and let me go ahead and attach.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's see.: Kevin Zhao (US): E.: Michael Buriek (US): Meeting minutes prompt structure to I'll attach the prompt structure.: Michael Buriek (US): As the fine tuning, so I don't need that ohm open and then.: Kevin Zhao (US): And some one email out.: Michael Buriek (US): Oh, I'm gonna send this to myself actually, Michael.: Michael Buriek (US): Meeting minutes.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Hey, I don't.: Michael Buriek (US): I don't wanna take too long because the meeting transcript will won't be able to use it.: Michael Buriek (US): So I'll just try to quickly teach you this last part and then I think we're good for today.: Michael Buriek (US): And then we can assign each other our tasks for the next meeting on this.: Michael Buriek (US): But let me pull this up.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like to be able to use this cause it's too long, it's gonna be too expensive.: Kevin Zhao (US): Or what's the?: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, no, it won't be too expensive yet.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): It'll probably cost like less way, less than a dollar, maybe like $0.50, but I paid.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I put $10 onto my chat GPT API to test all of this out, so this is good.: Kevin Zhao (US): Mm-hmm.: Michael Buriek (US): This will be great because this meeting is going on longer and we can actually see the number of tokens used and probably a standard meeting, so let's see.: Michael Buriek (US): I have this.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm going to go ahead and save as prompt structure, meeting minutes save and then let me pull up.: Michael Buriek (US): Where is it?: Michael Buriek (US): Borough.: Michael Buriek (US): These are not nice.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, share screen here.: Michael Buriek (US): It is prompt structure.: Michael Buriek (US): This is it dude.: Michael Buriek (US): All defined so and and honestly we can PW PwC FYI all this information that's something I wanted to do next to capture exactly the the process so that we can use this as a framework to build another solution after this and use the Microsoft suite to build the app for anything else we want to integrate which would be cool.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): And then just have like a portfolio, but OK, this is the structure that you send the API, they structure it, this is called JSON.: Michael Buriek (US): Basically it's JavaScript object notation and this is an object, so the curly braces are an object and it's saying OK, we have a key value pair.: Michael Buriek (US): The key is messages and the value is this list.: Michael Buriek (US): The list is designated by the brackets and in the list we have three other objects.: Michael Buriek (US): Now the first object is system context.: Michael Buriek (US): The second object is user input and the third object is assistant output.: Michael Buriek (US): So system is a role and the system role is often used to represent like system level instructions.: Michael Buriek (US): This is guidance for the chat bots behavior.: Michael Buriek (US): What that means is we have a trained chat bot or a trained transfer.: Kevin Zhao (US): Chat you could you just.: Michael Buriek (US): Whereas IT transformer, yeah, it's like it just knows English basically.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's like it's like Chachi, BT right? Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So it's just a, it's a capable human being.: Michael Buriek (US): Think about it like that.: Michael Buriek (US): But you haven't given it a job title and so you can have a capable human being do a lot of different tasks, but this guides it into specializing into one task.: Michael Buriek (US): Right now it's just a general analyst.: Michael Buriek (US): We want it to be a specialist, a subject matter expert, so we say, hey, you're an SME.: Michael Buriek (US): On meeting minute generate generation and you only generate meetings according to this format and you're really good at it.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, you take in meetings of all types.: Michael Buriek (US): Sometimes you're meetings have a bunch of random things set in them.: Michael Buriek (US): Ignore those.: Michael Buriek (US): Focus on the key items that are discussed.: Michael Buriek (US): Look for these keywords.: Michael Buriek (US): Look for the keyword key performance indicator.: Michael Buriek (US): Look for action items.: Michael Buriek (US): Look for announcements.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's all.: Michael Buriek (US): Look for these words it.: Kevin Zhao (US): And that's that's all in content.: Michael Buriek (US): That's all in the content.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, that's all in the content of system right here as context.: Michael Buriek (US): So that all goes into the context portion.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the structure that you wanna use.: Michael Buriek (US): That's what you're building out right now.: Michael Buriek (US): And so you're basically it's a job responsibility list.: Michael Buriek (US): It's these are your consultant for PwC and these are your job responsibilities as an Oracle data and analytics consultant.: Michael Buriek (US): There's everything you're gonna do.: Kevin Zhao (US): Got it.: Michael Buriek (US): That's what this first line does, and so this this text right here is super long.: Michael Buriek (US): The next one represents the person interacting with it, so that could be, let's say, Kevin, you.: Michael Buriek (US): You're the management consultant for PwC.: Michael Buriek (US): You know your job title and I'm the client and I'm like, hey, I need you to help with this with this situation.: Michael Buriek (US): So I send you my meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the meeting transcribed as input.: Michael Buriek (US): Then the assistant here represents the chat bots responses.: Michael Buriek (US): So when you train the model, when you when you, this is a basically A1 shot prompt because it gives one example.: Michael Buriek (US): So A1 shot prompt is saying hey, this is what you are.: Michael Buriek (US): This is a meeting transcription and this is the desired output.: Michael Buriek (US): If I give you another meeting transcription, can you do it?: Kevin Zhao (US): Mm-hmm.: Michael Buriek (US): It's been trained on one example, right?: Kevin Zhao (US): No.: Kevin Zhao (US): Knows what?: Michael Buriek (US): And so it's been trained on one example and then when we send in a second one, it already has what it is, what a typical user asks.: Kevin Zhao (US): Everybody it has like, yeah, the contacts, it just reuses the same context as before and it keeps building off of that.: Michael Buriek (US): Exactly.: Michael Buriek (US): So that's the.: Kevin Zhao (US): And that's assistant.: Kevin Zhao (US): You said that's assistant.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So that is assistant represents the chat bots responses.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): So that's the response.: Michael Buriek (US): So let's see system the role of system tells it's like a job responsibility list.: Michael Buriek (US): The role of the user is US asking it something.: Michael Buriek (US): Hey, here's a meeting transcript.: Michael Buriek (US): Can you put it into a good format?: Michael Buriek (US): Hey, yeah, I'm actually a professional at meeting minute generation and I have a format that I use.: Michael Buriek (US): Let me go ahead and whip that up for you.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's chatting too.: Michael Buriek (US): It whips it up and then this is the response.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's just the system function output is the final.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, the final output.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait, so I'm so you explain all of that?: Kevin Zhao (US): I get each one of these components, but in terms of Jason, I now just trying to understand if I were to write out prompt, I'd like to see an example of this cause.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right now we're just saying structure.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, so here's an example.: Kevin Zhao (US): Got it bro user.: Kevin Zhao (US): So it sounds like roll doesn't ever change.: Kevin Zhao (US): I like that.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, here's the context.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, so let's just yeah, OK. Yep.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the content I'm a user.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep.: Kevin Zhao (US): I.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, nice.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Maybe that's OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): That makes sense to me.: Kevin Zhao (US): Roll never changes.: Kevin Zhao (US): It's always system user assistant.: Michael Buriek (US): Role does change, role does change.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): This is a conversation, a message 1A message is a conversation and the conversation will often have different this one is you only see this once.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep.: Michael Buriek (US): The system object here is once because it defines what the chat bot is this role and this user role and this assistant role.: Kevin Zhao (US): So you yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, it just goes back and forth.: Michael Buriek (US): Sometimes you can prime your model with multiple of these, so I could actually do this troll C and I could have a conversation here and I could say on this one, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm like visualizing it like a chat cheap ET like having a conversation with chat.: Kevin Zhao (US): GPT.: Kevin Zhao (US): Really.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's that's what I'm visualizing it as.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is the the science of doing this really well and writing up something clean is called prompt engineering because how you structure this is important.: Michael Buriek (US): The reason why it's important is a transformer and then the hyperparameters you give it.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, let me show you that real quick.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is a lot, Kevin, maybe I I'll prepare this into a nicer.: Kevin Zhao (US): How do you keep keep talking?: Kevin Zhao (US): I I get it.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh here is this is a document that I just made to.: Kevin Zhao (US): And surprising that actually no.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, this this all makes sense to me.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, so here's open AI.: Michael Buriek (US): This is my notes on open AI and this is the hyperparameters.: Michael Buriek (US): So what we just talked about was the prompt.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, the model already knows English and the prompt helps us to guide the models responses.: Michael Buriek (US): These hyperparameters are also like little knobs on a machine that let us adjust the response that we get.: Michael Buriek (US): So not only do we send in a more a well crafted, crafted prompt, we can also adjust these to alter the response that we get.: Michael Buriek (US): Because what we don't want is a summary of agenda item 1 to be 5000 tokens.: Michael Buriek (US): Then we email a massive thing.: Michael Buriek (US): So one of the parameters for knobs that we can turn on this machine can be Max number of tokens.: Michael Buriek (US): This allows us to in this goes into our API call.: Michael Buriek (US): This allows us to adjust the response that we get O.: Michael Buriek (US): This helps us with verbosity.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): We can.: Michael Buriek (US): We can have a super concise response because now it's operating with a constraint.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait that?: Michael Buriek (US): Not only is it a it's not only a meeting generator, it can only generate a a meeting minute that is under 100 tokens and that way we know for a fact that we're gonna get a super good one and we can play around with these numbers.: Michael Buriek (US): There's code that I can I can write that helps us do this in a really structured way, but we can play around to get a good response.: Michael Buriek (US): Another one temperature hey?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So yeah, I I can review all this stuff, but just to back middle, where does this all fit into the prompt or these utilized in the prompt themselves?: Michael Buriek (US): Umm, no.: Kevin Zhao (US): Or or they being utilized somewhere else where?: Michael Buriek (US): So there there's two things.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the code.: Kevin Zhao (US): Where do we write out these hyperparameters?: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the I I write it out.: Michael Buriek (US): So in this create thing this is the prompt.: Michael Buriek (US): The prompt is here.: Michael Buriek (US): Summarize the key points from last meeting and these hyperparameters are passed to the API also right here.: Kevin Zhao (US): Got it.: Kevin Zhao (US): So.: Michael Buriek (US): So there are two different parts, but these two different parts hyperparameters and prompt engineering play a huge role into the type of response that we get back.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right where.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, so we have we're working with a JSON message.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's what you showed me before, where we're writing out the prompts, right? So.: Michael Buriek (US): No, you well, this this right here.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, that section, Jason.: Michael Buriek (US): This right here is is going to be Jason on the prompt and that's just because the model takes it.: Michael Buriek (US): You don't have to worry about it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): What you need to do is write in really clean like I just showed you this format because all it is is text.: Michael Buriek (US): We don't want boxes like this.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): We just want this, that that incorporates skeleton and flesh.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I got that.: Kevin Zhao (US): I got that the top portion I was just using as meeting minute template.: Kevin Zhao (US): I wasn't.: Michael Buriek (US): Ohh yeah, yeah yeah, no worries.: Kevin Zhao (US): I wasn't gonna use that as the prompt, so if we go but go back to the screen that you were showing.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh yeah, the code.: Michael Buriek (US): Ohh no.: Kevin Zhao (US): So if I'm looking at this clearly, the prompt that component is Jason.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Now the hyperparameters below temperature Max tokens, all of that is.: Michael Buriek (US): They're just parameters like think about your Java class from high school.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): You passed in a function a bunch of different parameters.: Michael Buriek (US): These are also parameters.: Kevin Zhao (US): Right.: Kevin Zhao (US): They could go.: Kevin Zhao (US): Usually they go in the parentheses.: Michael Buriek (US): So yeah, this function create.: Kevin Zhao (US): I mean, it looks like the prompt is in the, yeah?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, this function create takes all of these parameters and we're just giving it values when we pass, so it takes in a temperature.: Kevin Zhao (US): This is how you call the API.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, this is how you call it.: Michael Buriek (US): And all of these parameters have they adjust the model in very specific ways.: Michael Buriek (US): So and and they're described here.: Michael Buriek (US): I I just wrote these up to understand myself better, but I can share.: Michael Buriek (US): Do you want me to share with you my courses?: Michael Buriek (US): What is this?: Michael Buriek (US): This is where I write down everything I learn about the technology I'm working with, so I've already shared with you just one page from this one.: Michael Buriek (US): My machine learning and data science thing.: Michael Buriek (US): This is the one you've have, but I could share this with you if this helps.: Michael Buriek (US): I don't know.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): That and decision.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I can share it with you.: Michael Buriek (US): My education one if you.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, here's the thing.: Michael Buriek (US): I won't.: Michael Buriek (US): I want to turn all of this information because I wanna create a document that we can use whether whether it's at just its own individual page.: Michael Buriek (US): Here that I can share on notion or like a PowerPoint or whatever that has all this info for us to follow.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yes.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm so that we can teach whoever we bring on.: Michael Buriek (US): So I'm that's something that I'll work on.: Michael Buriek (US): I'll work on like a a knowledge base document.: Michael Buriek (US): The describes machine learning from like a usage perspective or like prompting.: Michael Buriek (US): That way, like if we bring anyone else, we can just say hey, read this.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I I like that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Well, you just explained a lot of prompting to me.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): I follow up.: Michael Buriek (US): So what do you need?: Michael Buriek (US): Yep, the code.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, if you can go back to that code that you would write out the function and the parameters. Umm.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's go back to the code.: Kevin Zhao (US): Where?: Kevin Zhao (US): What's the domain or like where?: Kevin Zhao (US): Where would you write this out?: Kevin Zhao (US): Is this in a Jupiter?: Michael Buriek (US): This is yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Nope. Like.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is here.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is more technical stuff, Kevin, but let me I'll just show it to you so.: Kevin Zhao (US): No, no, no, I like this.: Kevin Zhao (US): I like this.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm learning a lot.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK so.: Michael Buriek (US): Here it is.: Kevin Zhao (US): Give me the juice.: Michael Buriek (US): Here is the technical stuff on first first step you need to import open AI.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Michael Buriek (US): Open AI is a library that exists somewhere on the web.: Michael Buriek (US): This one line because it's in this environment goes on online and it says, hey, here is a a file with a bunch of functions and now I can use those functions and those functions connect to the computer where this model is stored, open AIS models and it lets me use them.: Michael Buriek (US): So just by doing this I have open AI available which is sick.: Michael Buriek (US): Then I come down here and I can't use it yet because there are.: Michael Buriek (US): It's expensive.: Michael Buriek (US): It costs money and they wanna protect it, so I have the cabin.: Michael Buriek (US): An API key to access the rest API to access the data in the model.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is doing that operating system is I have an API key that I can use if it's known.: Michael Buriek (US): Say I don't have one and then set the open AI model that I brought in, set the key to the key that I have.: Michael Buriek (US): Now I'm connected, so then I come down here and just prompt generation and this is really this is all the code that's required to connect to the model on a simple level I say hey, I want to use I'm just storing variables but this is it right here.: Michael Buriek (US): So open AI, I want to use chat completion model and I want you to create a response.: Michael Buriek (US): For me, the model I want to use is defined here as chat debt 3.5 turbo.: Michael Buriek (US): The message for the prompt that I wanna give you is defined here.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep.: Michael Buriek (US): So this has the context, the user and the assistant.: Michael Buriek (US): Like we just talked about, I'm only defining 1 hyperparameter.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's my temperature.: Michael Buriek (US): I want it to be deterministic.: Michael Buriek (US): I don't want creativity.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I want you to follow this thing to a tee then.: Michael Buriek (US): It's exactly what I'm doing.: Michael Buriek (US): Those are variables that I'm I'm using in this.: Kevin Zhao (US): So that top portion in the the model equal equals whatever, but you're declaring it sounds like you're declaring variables up there and then down below, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): In this rest API query.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): And then I get my response back.: Michael Buriek (US): The response is stored in a variable, and that's a Jason object and I print it out.: Kevin Zhao (US): Night.: Michael Buriek (US): So you can see it.: Michael Buriek (US): Here's the JSON object and it just has all these key value pairs.: Michael Buriek (US): It has choices.: Michael Buriek (US): It has created timestamp.: Michael Buriek (US): It has an ID.: Michael Buriek (US): It has the model that was used.: Michael Buriek (US): It has the object.: Michael Buriek (US): It was a chat completion one and it tells me the number of tokens where required.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm to run this model and then it also gives me the response I wanted in the content and then I extract that here response choices there's choices, message message content content and I get it and then I print it out and it's all there.: Michael Buriek (US): That's the code now.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let me can I see that?: Kevin Zhao (US): Can I see the output down there?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, yeah, this is.: Michael Buriek (US): This was with my.: Kevin Zhao (US): If you keep going down the yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Fake conversation.: Kevin Zhao (US): So meeting agenda.: Kevin Zhao (US): Tech transformation project that.: Michael Buriek (US): But I can give you more training, Kevin, on this.: Michael Buriek (US): This is like.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm curious what the what was it?: Kevin Zhao (US): How the transcript look like?: Kevin Zhao (US): But it was it was a pretty long or was it short?: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, no, it wasn't that long.: Michael Buriek (US): I can.: Michael Buriek (US): I can show you later, but the reason why I wanna finish up earlier is at 3:00 PM.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm I'm meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm actually well, I don't wanna talk about it on the call, but I'm I'm meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, I can.: Michael Buriek (US): Whatever.: Michael Buriek (US): We're probably not gonna use is that I have a meeting with the therapist at three.: Michael Buriek (US): So I just wanted to like get ready for it.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh, after your therapist appointment, do you wanna serve?: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): Taylor once again.: Kevin Zhao (US): Five.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'll probably go a little bit sooner around like 4430.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, I will let you know after I just don't know yet.: Michael Buriek (US): Umm.: Michael Buriek (US): If I can make, I don't wanna commit without knowing if I can.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's fine.: Michael Buriek (US): But do you understand a lot more after that?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I mean to be fair, I'm probably gonna that ladder portion.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm probably gonna forget how you would go about declaring the variable and then going into like the different functions in there, but in terms of prompts.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I know a lot more now and I understand that JSON formatting so that and that's that's very important cuz JSON is I think the number one it's it's pretty much the format that a lot of systems love to consume.: Michael Buriek (US): Everything is used, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Dude, of course it does.: Kevin Zhao (US): So knowing Jason's very important, Appian loves Jason, so I hear that getting thrown around a lot.: Kevin Zhao (US): So it's good to know it.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, now we're way over.: Michael Buriek (US): I know.: Kevin Zhao (US): We should probably start thinking about the next call.: Kevin Zhao (US): We we submitted the idea.: Kevin Zhao (US): That's good.: Kevin Zhao (US): We're waiting for a response.: Michael Buriek (US): I'll wait for I'll wait for the response from these dudes.: Kevin Zhao (US): I already I I I put together the the constraints document but honestly I do we wanna review that or would you rather just focus on meeting minutes and see if we get this we get meeting minutes and then I don't think we really need to touch that.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, let's not touch it.: Michael Buriek (US): So this is what I'm going to do.: Kevin Zhao (US): Others to put in here.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm going to what I have showed you is a super rough draft.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Super Rough Draft of the the idea I want to flush out a really good Jupiter notebook and I also want to create a structure that I want to learn how to use the Microsoft API the graph API so and then what I'm gonna try to do is tell my story all in this Jupiter notebook because that's what they do for machine learning projects and and I'm just gonna work on building this out so that when we bring anyone on each area of code is defined.: Michael Buriek (US): It's well commented.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): It's described carefully on the hyperparameters are defined right in the document, so that when you read it Kevin, you could learn all about, umm, prompt or generative AI while you're looking at a real life use case.: Michael Buriek (US): And this could be our structure for any future project, because then the structure will stay there.: Michael Buriek (US): In this Jupiter notebook and all we change out is the code of the prompt that we're sending in the response.: Michael Buriek (US): How we deal with the response etcetera and that's the ideal like there are already projects out there that do a really good job at that.: Michael Buriek (US): But we're working also with Microsoft, so that's unique to us and that's why building out a good framework would be kind of cool.: Michael Buriek (US): And we'll learn a lot doing it.: Kevin Zhao (US): But yeah, yeah, I mean the API's are gonna be a huge differentiator.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I I think what you're gonna be doing right now is gonna be very helpful for us, Michael.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): But let's just try to add some more structure.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): Our calls so we can start tackling this from a more project management mindset, right?: Michael Buriek (US): OK, you're right.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): So, right.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm getting deep.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): No, it's all good.: Michael Buriek (US): I'm deep in it because I'm trying to learn as much as I can too, so let's let's go high level, high level.: Michael Buriek (US): What we really need is we just need to wait for the response from these guys.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yep.: Michael Buriek (US): Uh, that's one thing we gotta do.: Kevin Zhao (US): Block template.: Michael Buriek (US): We really need to work on the prompt, which you're gonna do, and then I can follow up on.: Michael Buriek (US): And then we also really need to figure out how we're gonna ingest the transcripts.: Michael Buriek (US): So, because that's gonna work for that's an important part on on on this project in general, how are we gonna feed anything into it?: Michael Buriek (US): Well, maybe that is also in the weeds.: Michael Buriek (US): I don't know, Kevin.: Kevin Zhao (US): Wait, what?: Kevin Zhao (US): I I I'm.: Michael Buriek (US): We don't really our project we we really don't need to do anything.: Michael Buriek (US): We're done.: Michael Buriek (US): We're done with everything we need to do for it.: Michael Buriek (US): Building it out now is a personal project.: Michael Buriek (US): We don't have to do this.: Kevin Zhao (US): So we already have a proof of concept.: Michael Buriek (US): Our POC is done dude POC is done.: Michael Buriek (US): It's submitted what we are building now is the project and the project.: Kevin Zhao (US): And but remember, there's a demo portion.: Michael Buriek (US): Oh, Oh yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So we have to be ready to demo right.: Michael Buriek (US): Our demo has to be clean.: Michael Buriek (US): OK, OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I think proof of concept.: Kevin Zhao (US): Cool.: Kevin Zhao (US): But I'm I wanna get deeper.: Kevin Zhao (US): There's we have, we have a pretty good concept.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's run with it.: Kevin Zhao (US): And I mean you, you have a really good understanding of what we need to be doing, Michael.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I'll just follow whatever your lead is I.: Michael Buriek (US): So well, this is what I wanna do.: Michael Buriek (US): Then for for our good.: Michael Buriek (US): If we have to make a presentation right on this, what we're gonna need to do is, and this will help me.: Kevin Zhao (US): Uh.: Michael Buriek (US): Ah, maybe we'll set up a working session where we'll create the flow chart of all of the dependencies of this project that we can think of, and also from a users perspective, how they'll interact with it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yes, I need it, dude.: Michael Buriek (US): And then the architect, the architecture of the actual project, those things we can totally we can do together.: Kevin Zhao (US): If you give me a data architecture diagram, let that be the North Star, I will make sense of everything.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do that and then we can build each part individually.: Kevin Zhao (US): It will make things way easier.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I think we start with the architecture diagram lastly.: Kevin Zhao (US): Mm-hmm.: Michael Buriek (US): So our next working session we'll do, yeah, next working session, we'll do our architecture, our process flows from different perspectives, from the design of the model, the technologies we'll use to create it of the application to the architecture of it.: Michael Buriek (US): And we should just do a working session where we talk through those things.: Michael Buriek (US): We communicate with our limitations or constraints, which are we're gonna be using Microsoft.: Michael Buriek (US): It's the firm software.: Michael Buriek (US): We're probably gonna be using SDK, which is the one that AI factor uses.: Michael Buriek (US): So what does that mean?: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, all those systems.: Michael Buriek (US): We're probably gonna be using the graph API because we need to connect to teams, so all those things will reflect in the architecture.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, we need that in work texture in in terms of process process flow, I I know you have your more tech.: Michael Buriek (US): No, that was just me trying to communicate. Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I mean that, that ones, I I looking at it like the icons, it makes sense to me the process flows that I wanna start creating or the ones that have like swim lanes that are tied to either.: Michael Buriek (US): You'd like a beautiful one.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do it.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do it.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, like a Visio diagram like and I can I can.: Kevin Zhao (US): I can write it down.: Kevin Zhao (US): You just have to tell me what exactly the vision is and I'll I'll put it into like layman terms and make it sound more digestible for anybody.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's do that.: Michael Buriek (US): And also another thing that we need to consider is when you build building, building a production ready application has administrative stuff that would be so cool to integrate in our solution.: Michael Buriek (US): The reason being is production ready applications take into account authorization, security and overall environment usage.: Michael Buriek (US): So I would like to work that into the architecture too, and I'll have to learn a lot about that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Ohh no this huge.: Michael Buriek (US): But that way, when we're building this, we have a blueprint for something, Kevin, that could be like in my opinion, if we can like deliver a packaged Polish tool, that would be crazy, like, hey, the app, the app is already built, guys, we built it using these technologies.: Michael Buriek (US): Here are the security measures in place.: Michael Buriek (US): You just need to plug this in.: Michael Buriek (US): You have to give it a like elevated rights.: Michael Buriek (US): We already built it.: Michael Buriek (US): It's available to be integrated in these applications and I think all of it is possible because the solution is simple.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): The solution is what it's doing is simple, but it just needs it's the.: Michael Buriek (US): It's the integrating it that's going to be the hardest part, and that's stuff that I wanna learn because the future PwC just took on Microsoft as a technology.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): They're gonna be using Microsoft indefinitely if we if we build one tool and understand the whole Microsoft environment really well, then we can easily build another tool.: Michael Buriek (US): Hey now I wanna do meeting generation that that goes into this.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's pull out the framework and let's just build another one, you know.: Kevin Zhao (US): No, I I 100% agree with you.: Kevin Zhao (US): So I'm gonna resetter the conversation again.: Michael Buriek (US): Sorry, sorry.: Kevin Zhao (US): Agenda for next call.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, so First off, action items, action items, let's put some so.: Michael Buriek (US): Process process flows and architecture.: Michael Buriek (US): That's it.: Kevin Zhao (US): But that's but that we're not creating that right now for before the next call are we, is that something that we're gonna be working on?: Michael Buriek (US): Oh, no, no, no.: Michael Buriek (US): We're not gonna.: Michael Buriek (US): No.: Michael Buriek (US): We're gonna just do that on the call.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Because I think that agenda for next call is work, the next call is going to be architecture diagram process for I mean dude, I'm not gonna lie.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't know if we have enough time.: Michael Buriek (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Well, then, well, here's what we can do, Kevin.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like, I don't think one hour is gonna be enough to do it, but but it could be as short.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): No, I can also.: Kevin Zhao (US): Let's just we could start with it right, content.: Michael Buriek (US): I can also come in with a starting copy so that we don't spend the whole time and then we can.: Michael Buriek (US): What we'll do is we'll Polish it. Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK, so I'm cool with that Michael to draft up. Uh.: Kevin Zhao (US): First or yeah, initial architect.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, I would.: Kevin Zhao (US): Do you wanna do architecture diagram or process for both?: Kevin Zhao (US): What what do you want?: Michael Buriek (US): I would like to do the architecture.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): I wanna know all the technology because I wanna see it more clearly.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Right now my vision is limited and So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna research production level applications to see how they're built.: Michael Buriek (US): Just look through the directories and understand what they use.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And level.: Kevin Zhao (US): Matt, how?: Kevin Zhao (US): How different is it to go from the other environments?: Kevin Zhao (US): I I I like I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm thinking are you trying to create a different architecture diagram depending on what environment we're in leading up to production?: Kevin Zhao (US): Or are you saying?: Michael Buriek (US): Well, no. Well.: Michael Buriek (US): How do I say this? Umm.: Kevin Zhao (US): You I I get the end goal is like you wanna go live with an actual product that people can take on right away off the bat from the get go instead of us having to sift through all this other additional overhead to get it into production.: Kevin Zhao (US): But what?: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, well, here's what I'm what?: Michael Buriek (US): What? I'm.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, like I mean we have search somewhere like a sandbox or something.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't know.: Michael Buriek (US): I have one.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like what we're doing right now is not production.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, so.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): I already have a sandbox, so Microsoft has a developer program which I signed up for and they have a mini fake company with like 15 plus users that you can use and you can build apps in this environment.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, but it's very limited.: Michael Buriek (US): Basically, it lets you practice all of the tools that they have it it is limited.: Michael Buriek (US): The idea is to build it for this mini organization that they give you.: Michael Buriek (US): Build the app and then just understand that you can scale it at that point because.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): So I'm trying to make the architecture with actual tools that we'll use for it and just build it there. But.: Kevin Zhao (US): Like assuming, assuming we have the right of a, a higher environment or like let's say, let's say you know we pay for production server right, we have all those things that are disposal.: Kevin Zhao (US): How are we going to craft the most ideal optimal system?: Michael Buriek (US): Dude, that's a that's an involved question and I have a lot of answers for that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): But I I think when I build out the framework I will show you the factors to consider like post security, authorization, uh usability.: Kevin Zhao (US): I don't think we're going to be able to pay for it ourselves.: Michael Buriek (US): All these things will be displayed in it.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): Now we won't.: Michael Buriek (US): So that's why the architecture will show that.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I love that.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Michael Buriek (US): Prompt, yeah.: Kevin Zhao (US): So action item Michael drafted up initial architecture diagram Kevin to work on OPS engineering or I'm say prompt template whatever.: Kevin Zhao (US): What else is that good enough?: Michael Buriek (US): That's good.: Michael Buriek (US): Let's just start there.: Kevin Zhao (US): OK.: Kevin Zhao (US): And then agenda of architecture diagram, process flow, prompt template.: Kevin Zhao (US): I'm also gonna say just review response.: Kevin Zhao (US): From.: Kevin Zhao (US): AI team Oracle from what's the guy's name? Black.: Michael Buriek (US): Dude, but Noah blackhead.: Michael Buriek (US): Black meat.: Michael Buriek (US): What the?: Kevin Zhao (US): No blackhead dude that last.: Michael Buriek (US): Yeah, dude, I'm gonna hop off because I wanna prep for this meeting.: Michael Buriek (US): I have at three.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah.: Michael Buriek (US): I kinda wanna like decompress and like pull out some notes for it so.: Kevin Zhao (US): Yeah, I date.: Kevin Zhao (US): Of course, dear thing.: Michael Buriek (US): I will.: Kevin Zhao (US): Keep me posted with surf and I'll chat with you soon.: Kevin Zhao (US): Dude, this is good stuff.: Michael Buriek (US): All right.: Michael Buriek (US): Thank you, Kevin.: Kevin Zhao (US): Eat anything.: Michael Buriek (US): By then I need.::
